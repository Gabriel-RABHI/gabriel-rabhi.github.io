# Who I am ?
## A resume
Capable of business, strategic and technological analysis, I'm what you'd call an atypical developer. Creator of a video game at the age of 18 (Mindscape Bordeaux, Pearson group at the time), passionate about R&D, I'm self-taught in programming (Pascal, C, C++, C#), software architecture and framework design. Creative, I was also a 2D and 3D computer graphics designer (bitmap, vector and modeling, rendering, animation under Maya and ex-Alias), in multimedia (sound, video, motion graphics) and incidentally, a composer (home-studio). These diverse skills provide me with a valuable general culture in what has become my main activity : software architecture and development. With a solid psychology background, I'm viewed as a smooth manager able to to write clean, expressive and consistent well illustrated documentations that drive developers to understandable goals.

I've been self-employed for a long time and have worked with several contractors over the long term. I like working in a team. The variety of my professional experiences has given me a certain understanding of what a company is, its strategic challenges and business expectations. It makes me appreciated by top management, even if my expectations are highs. I can handle projects requiring long-term, sometimes multi-dimensional work. I have practiced SCRUM and adopt industry practices (DDD, TDD, SOLID principles). I keep a close eye on architectural developments (CQRS, Event Sourcing, etc.). My great satisfaction lies in creating innovative architectures to best deliver business value and meet market needs.

Getting out of my comfort zone, taking on challenges and deploying bold approaches is a real driving force for me. Since 2010, one of my research topics has been a high-performance persistent object repository for .Net : "Big Memory" and "HPC". In the past : distributed database, graphical interface, 3D engine and between 2014 and 2020 a Full Stack Web HTML5-JS-CSS social networking engine, a proprietary Web server, proprietary SGDB NoSQL and Graph, text indexing (WAH), lock-free concurrency processing, internet supervision and data replication in Edge Computing, etc. Although I'm not a mathematician, I have a keen sense of what can be done with a computer, and I'm creative in the solutions I implement, never hesitating to challenge the state of the art.
