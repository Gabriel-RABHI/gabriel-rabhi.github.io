# Few past projects

**I’ve done a large number of projects for my customers and as personal researches. The majority are projects for customers. There is a lot of software that I developed for which I don’t have screenshots. Here are a few.**

**1995 : Al Unser Jr Arcade Racing**, a small arcade video game I have entirely developed, from scratch. Presented by Bill Gates as the first Windows 95 arcade simulation game. Sold in Japan and USA, near one million copy distributed.

### EZ-World (1996)

EZ-World was a runtime and development environment for Max OS 9. It was a side project. I have written the GUI engine from scratch. Buttons, menus, window, etc. were written from scratch. One of the important features was that the user interface of the softwares that worked in this environment was editable at runtime: windows and widgets could be created at runtime, and linked to commands published by the software components.

There is a high level of isolation beetween the “business” or “processing” code and the UI. The first apps running on this screen-shots are painting, compositing and multimedia tools.
